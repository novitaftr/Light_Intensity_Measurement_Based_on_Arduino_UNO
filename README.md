## Light Intensity Measurement Tool with LDR Based on Arduino UNO

Basically, humans need sufficient lighting with varying intensities for different needs, so it's important to know the intensity of light. A luxmeter is used to measure light intensity, but it's hard to find and quite expensive. Therefore, a much cheaper device to measure light intensity was designed. The device starts with circuit design, followed by device design, calibration, and testing. This device uses an Arduino Uno-based Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity, with the results displayed on an LCD. Testing shows that this Arduino Uno-based LDR light intensity meter has an error rate ranging from 0.11% to 3.92% in measurements.
